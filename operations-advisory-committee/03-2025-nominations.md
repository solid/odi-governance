## Nominees

### Alain Bourgeois

I was involved in solid community since 2017, progressively and now at the same time :

- as a co-developper on solid-file-client and as participant or owner in other apps solid-rest, tiddliwiki for solid ...
- migrating data links from solid.community to solidcommunity.net
- took responsability to the management of solidcommunity.net, including documentation in wiki and test-server
- After first involvement in blokking issues in NSSv5 I ended as the main maintainer of NSS, and participant of the test-suite.
- As Solid Admin I had responsability in some Github/npm accounts
- I am co-maintainer/publisher of SolidOS stack including RdfLib

In February 2025 I made the data migration of NSS to Pivot favour of CSS
I'm administrator of the Solid-test server

I am a member of Solid Community Group (formerly Solid Team), SolidOS Group and was from its inception a member of Solid Code of Conduct Commitee.

I am a retiree and I have no Institutional affiliation.

### Thhck

I'm a web developpeur working on [Liquid.surf](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf), which aims to lower the entry barrier into the Solid world for both users and programmers. I have an understanding of the CSS codebase and its Components.js dependency injection framework, which has been my main contribution to the Solid community::

- I have implemented various CSS components ([FedCM](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/fedcm-demo), [OIDC-OAuth bridge](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/css-direct-sso-auth)) and host a CSS/Penny recipe at pod.liquid.surf

- I'm assisting with the NSS to CSS transition of solidcommunity.net by building new components, such as:
  - a [simpler registration page](https://github.com/thhck/css-simple-register-component)
  - and re-implementing the [proxy](https://github.com/thhck/css-proxy-module).

I'm currently also exploring other standards such as [Braid](https://braid.org) and Activity Pub and how they can interoperate with Solid.

I have been granted by the NLnet fund for working on liquid.surf ( if that count as an institutionnal affiliation )

### Rui Zhao

I was involved in Solid community since 2022:

- Active participant in various activities:
  - Regular participant of meetings: regular attendee of SolidOS Weekly (until ~ mid-2024), Solid Practitioner, Solid CG and LWS WG meetings
  - Been involved in lots of Solid-related activities / conferences, such as co-organising the Privacy Session at Solid Symposium 2025
  - Created / Joined many feature / roadmap discussions, at forum.solidcommunity.org, `solid/specification`, `w3c/lws-ucs`, etc
- Operational experience with Solid:
  - As the service maintainer for my group's Solid server
  - Created several bug reporting and fixing for Solid-related projects
  - As a developer for libraries solid-helper-vue and solid-helper, and tools like PermiX and solid-fuse

I am currently (since 2022) a postdoctoral researcher at Univeristy of Oxford, on the EWADA project. My research is thus highly related to Solid, and have several papers about novel data (storage, usage, privacy, permission) architectures on Solid, such as [Libertas](<[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16365](https://oxfordhcc.github.io/libertas/)>), [psDToU](https://me.ryey.icu/solid-dtou/), [SocialGenPod](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408).

Other than Solid, I have abundant deep experience with other decentralised (social) technologies/architectures, and constantly compare their differences in strengths.

This should justify my experience and knowledge of operational and future-looking work with Solid, for all protocol, server and app/client sides. Thus I consider myself a suitable candicate for the Solid Operations Advisory Committee, with enough experience for making the right advice in technical and roadmap related topics.
