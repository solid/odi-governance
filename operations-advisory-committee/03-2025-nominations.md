### Thhck

I'm a web developpeur working on [Liquid.surf](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf), which aims to lower the entry barrier into the Solid world for both users and programmers. I have an understanding of the CSS codebase and its Components.js dependency injection framework, which has been my main contribution to the Solid community::

 - I have implemented various CSS components ([FedCM](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/fedcm-demo), [OIDC-OAuth bridge](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/css-direct-sso-auth)) and host a CSS/Penny recipe at pod.liquid.surf 

 - I'm assisting with the NSS to CSS transition of solidcommunity.net by building new components, such as:
   -  a [simpler registration page](https://github.com/thhck/css-simple-register-component)
   -  and re-implementing the [proxy](https://github.com/thhck/css-proxy-module). 

I'm currently also exploring other standards such as [Braid](https://braid.org) and Activity Pub and how they can interoperate with Solid. 

I have been granted by the NLnet fund for working on liquid.surf ( if that count as an institutionnal affiliation )
