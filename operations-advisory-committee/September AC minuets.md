* **Attendance & Opening**  
  * **Louise opened the meeting by checking participant attendance and confirming who had accepted or declined the invitation**   
  * **Louise welcomed everyone, greeting participants from different time zones and thanked them for dedicating their time to support Solid at ODI.**  
  * **Jesse Wright asked if everyone was comfortable with the meeting being recorded and confirmed its activation**

**Recruitment Update:**

* **Two senior developers have been appointed (one started recently and the other about a month ago); these hires are familiar with Solid.**  
  * **A front-end developer has been offered a position and is expected to start mid-October.**  
    * **Recruitment for a community manager is ongoing with second round interviews underway after the initial candidate could not commit.**  
* **Work Package Two: Technical Infrastructure**  
  * **Website & Front-End Updates:**  
    * **The Solid Project website has been revamped with an improved user journey, a redesigned homepage featuring a large logo and updated navigation for users to access the Solid apps page.**  
    * **Use of templating has been introduced on the website to reduce repetitive content and ease future updates.**  
  * **Solidcommunity.net Discussion:**  
    * **Solidcommunity.net has been running for about five years with approximately 60,000 user pods and is used mainly by developers for experimentation.**  
    * **There was extensive discussion about continuing ODI’s role in maintaining solidcommunity.net given the compliance challenges (content moderation, data protection risks regarding the Online Safety Act).**  
    * **Comments were made about splitting responsibilities between an ID server and a POD server, exploring alternative hosting arrangements, and possibly cost-sharing or documenting best practices for community providers.**  
  * **Open Source Codebases & SolidOS:**  
    * **ODI is triaging the various repositories on GitHub by archiving some and moving others to the solid contrib organization, with a focus on timely issue and pull request triaging.**  
    * **Discussions touched upon whether ODI should invest in making an enterprise-ready, ISO 27001 compliant server given estimated costs running into 3 million euros, with consensus toward supporting community experiments through free licenses and cloud credits.**  
* **Work Package Three: Use Cases & Applications**  
  * **Landscape Review & Use Case Framework:**  
    * **An extensive landscape review of the Solid ecosystem is underway using a catalog of stakeholders, use cases, and applications to guide further actions.**  
    * **The framework will help prioritize and support use cases by establishing sector-specific working groups and gathering metrics on stakeholder engagement.**  
  * **Proposed Use Cases:**  
    * **Learning Product Integration: Pilot use of Solid within ODI’s own learning product by porting XAPI learning records into individual pods.**  
    * **Application Generator: Exploring a tool that allows end users to describe desired Solid applications and then automatically generating compliant applications using existing front-end tooling and linked open vocabularies.**  
  * **Broader Use Case Opportunities:**  
    * **Calls were made for use cases addressing marginalized communities, challenges in the global south, climate data reporting, and municipal/social services to highlight Solid’s potential to solve real-world problems.**  
    * **Discussions emphasized academic involvement, integration with universities, and courses to drive real-world adoption.**  
  * **Tournaments & Hackathons:**  
    * **The idea of organizing “tournaments” (as opposed to traditional hackathons) was proposed to encourage participation from a broad range of people including developers, product designers, and front-end experts.**  
    * **Plans include hosting tournaments during the week of the Solid Symposium with both remote and in-person components, regional hubs, and potential integration with existing hackathon networks.**  
    * **Additional input was requested on how existing projects could cross-fund these events to overcome onboarding roadblocks.**  
* **Community Engagement & Educational Materials**  
  * **Contributor & Volunteer Structures:**  
    * **ODI aims to onboard at least 200 new developers through improved contribution pathways, including active triaging of GitHub issues, pull requests, and enhanced community engagement.**  
    * **Discussion focused on establishing formal governance structures for community groups (practitioners, community groups, and linked web storage groups) with regular reports and a potential subcommittee system.**  
  * **Educational Materials:**  
    * **ODI is developing explainer materials, quick-start guides, onboarding documentation for developers, and organizational resources that highlight the value of Solid.**  
    * **There was discussion about categorizing educational content for different audiences (general, technical, beginners, professionals) and ensuring accessibility for non-English speakers and users with different needs.**  
    * **Suggestions included crowdsourcing documentation, involving professional trainers, and possibly establishing a Solid-approved certificate or standardized curriculum.**  
* **Communication & Ways of Working**  
  * **Channels and Platforms:**  
    * **Debate over the effectiveness of current channels (Matrix, Slack, and reference to a potential Discord group) took place; suggestions included conducting a community survey to gauge preferences.**  
    * **Participants discussed the need to reduce fragmentation of query responses, improve response times on forums, and ensure beginner questions receive adequate attention.**  
  * **Meeting Times & Updates:**  
    * **A proposal was made to rotate meeting start times to accommodate different time zones (e.g. shifting December meeting times) without affecting in-person events like the Solid Symposium.**  
* **Closing Remarks & Next Steps**  
  * **Homework was assigned to identify use cases and applications for the newly established Solid instance, with participants encouraged to share ideas via Slack or email.**  
  * **Key areas for deep-dive discussions at the next meeting were identified as the funding strategy, the use case framework, and the advocacy/communications strategy.**  
  * **The next advisory committee meeting is planned for December with an in-person component at the Solid Symposium in April.**  
  * **Louise and the team expressed gratitude for the productive discussion and contributions, and emphasized a commitment to follow up on the various action points raised during the meeting.**
