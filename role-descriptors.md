# Solid Advisory Committee Role Descriptions
Solid, an open-source initiative led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, is reimagining data use, reuse and sharing by giving everyone the option to share a range of data - including personal, organizational or commercial - securely, for social and economic benefit. With applications across digital health, AI, and financial inclusion, Solid holds immense potential as a transformative vector for societal impact. To date, Solid technologies have already been used in numerous projects including:  
 - Improving citizens access to services, including the homeless 
 - Building more resilient and sustainable food supply chains
 - Democratising media and social media
 - Improving the integration of health data for analytics and sharing between service providers
 
“The ODI and Solid’s, now shared vision - to establish a data ecosystem that benefits individuals, organisations and society - reflects my own. It is an opportunity to correct our global data infrastructure to one that encourages collaboration, stimulates creativity and fosters compassion - my original hope for the web.”
 - Sir Tim Berners-Lee
