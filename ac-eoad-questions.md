**Equal Opportunities & Diversity Monitoring Form**

To ensure our organization represents all users of the Web we must take a data-driven approach to our board recruitment process. This form will only be used to ensure our board recruitment process is targeting diverse communities as well as to ensure accommodations can be met. This form is not meant as a 'tick box exercise' that reduces an applicant's experience to a series of boxes on a page, but it is one way we can hold ourselves accountable to ensuring our outreach processes are working and to know if we need to adapt our strategy.
